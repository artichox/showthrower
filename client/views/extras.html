                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <p><a href="showthrower.com">SHOWTHROWER</a> is a concert crowdfunding platform. Promoters start campaigns to throw concerts and fans pledge to buy tickets. When a campaign reaches its funding goal, the concert is confirmed and the show is thrown. If a campaign does not reach its funding goal, the show is not thrown and fans keep their money.</p>
                <p>Our goal is to use crowdfunding to democratize live music in the same way that <a href="http://kickstarter.com/">KICKSTARTER</a> has used crowdfunding to democratize art and design.</p>
